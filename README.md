This is a go / baduk server.

### Hacking

First, start the backend server.

```
make run
```

Your terminal window or tab is blocked now, so open a new one.

You may have to run `npm i` once, in `src/main/client`.

From the project root, you can now start the dev server:

```
make dev
```

The app is running at [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006/app).

Try editing a file in `src/main/client/src`.
The change should immediately be visible in the browser.
